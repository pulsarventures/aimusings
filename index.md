**AIMusings** is a series of personal observations I have been making as we transition from the Information Age to the Intelligent Age. As I integrate AI into both my work and personal life, I find myself noticing patterns—whether I’m Zooming In on an AI-augmented task or Zooming Out to reflect on broader themes across work, life, and conversations with others.

P.S. I considered calling these deliberations, reflections, or ruminations—but “musings” felt just right. It strikes a balance between being informative and fun, without sounding too formal or serious (which, if you know me, isn’t really my vibe). Hope you enjoy the content!

These are currently individual posts, but over time I’ll be organizing them into sections and chapters.
