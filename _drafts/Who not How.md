**We used to ask: “Who can help me get this done?”**

  

Now, in the Intelligent Age, the better question is:

**“Which Agent can do this for me?”**

  

This shift isn’t subtle — it’s a complete rethinking of leverage.

  

Let’s rewind.

---

**In the Industrial Age**, leverage was physical.

**In the Information Age**, leverage was digital.

**Now, in the Intelligent Age**, leverage is _agentic_ — driven by intelligent systems that think, reason, and act on our behalf.

  

The book _Who Not How_ gave us a powerful mindset: delegate to others, don’t do it all yourself.

But what if your next “Who” isn’t a person at all?

---

**Enter the Agent Era.**

  

Not virtual assistants. Not basic bots.

But _intelligent_, task-specific Agents — systems that can analyze, decide, and execute.

  

This changes everything:

  

**1. From Headcount to Capability**

You don’t need to hire a 5-person team to scale your startup.

One founder with the right stack of Agents can go toe-to-toe with companies 10x their size.

  

**2. Workflow Becomes a Conversation**

Just like you’d brief a colleague, now you _prompt_ an Agent.

The new managerial skill isn’t task execution — it’s _prompt precision_.

  

**3. Infinite Leverage**

Agents don’t sleep, don’t forget, and don’t get distracted.

They operate in parallel, iterate in real-time, and scale with every new dataset.

  

**4. The Rise of the Agent Network**

Your edge isn’t just who you know — it’s _what you deploy_.

Imagine your own intelligent stack of legal Agents, research Agents, proposal-writing Agents…

The new power network is hybrid: human and machine.

---

**So what does this mean for builders, operators, founders?**

  

You don’t need to reinvent the wheel.

You need to rethink how it spins.

  

It’s not about learning how to do more.

It’s about **delegating better to smarter systems**.

  

**Agentic leverage is the new compounding edge.**

---

**The question isn’t “How do I do this?” anymore.**

It’s:

**“Which Agent should I activate?”**
