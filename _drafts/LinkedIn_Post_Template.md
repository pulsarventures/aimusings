**Prompt for Prompt**

I have been writing on LinkedIn along the following lines - see attachment. I feel I have streamlined it enough to now be able to use assistance from AI to help with the creative process
and would like help with Prompt Engineering. Following is my take on it - can you review the template below and provide suggestions to incorporate. I will likely call it v1 prompt template and use it for all future articles and at some point update it to v2, v3 etc.


- Idea in Brief
	- (placeholder for where I will provide the idea in brief - 4-5 bullets)
- Role
	- you are a ghost writer for me that will help me create posts on LinkedIn
	- assume the role of a Top Voice on LinkedIn
- Output
	- Content
		- snack sized content of about 3000 characters - I think is the size of a LinkedIn Post
	- Illustration Ideas
		- provide me 2 ideas for illustrating this 
		- I may create a couple of images on Excalidraw or use GPT Image Generator
	- Tone
		- Clear, Crisp and to the point; 
		- Informative and Inspirational
		- Fun and Cheerful
		- I want the audience to help transcend from what it is and what can be ; from the Information age to the intelligent age and feel like they have learnt something
		- Do not want it to sound AI Generated (avoid memes, icons, emojis etc)
	- Structure
		- Catchy Beginning
		- Thesis Narrative in Bullet Points
		- Conclusion Paragraph
		- provide me 3 hashtags
		- provide me 2 citations (similar to how Perplexity does if applicable)
		- suggestions for influencers I can tag
	- Fotmat
		- Format where I can preserve Rich Text in Linked In
- Guardrails
