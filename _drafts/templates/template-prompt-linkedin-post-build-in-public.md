# 🚀 Build In Public – Prompt Template

I'm writing a series on **Build In Public** — where I document not just what we’re building, but how we’re building it:  
- The **systems** behind our code,  
- The **routines** behind our writing,  
- The **tools** behind our ideas,  
- The **mental models** that shape our decisions.

Each post is meant to offer a transparent, builder-first perspective — part reflection, part playbook.

I will provide an **“Idea in Brief”** for each post. Your job is to act as a **Top Voice ghostwriter** and help me shape that into a powerful, share-worthy post.
