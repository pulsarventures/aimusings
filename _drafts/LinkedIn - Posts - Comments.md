# 1. The opening hook (first 10 words)

**Bad**: “Great post! Totally agree!”

**Good**: “Had a similar experience. One key lesson stood out…”

# 2. The value-add (next 1–2 sentences)

**Bad**: “This is so important.”

**Good**: “We reduced onboarding steps from 5 to 3 and saw a 31% increase in completions. The key was focusing on the ‘aha moment’ early.”

# 3. The engagement hook (final sentence)

**Bad**: “Thanks for sharing!”

**Good**: “Have you seen this work differently for smaller teams?”  
(or just leave this part if you don’t have a meaningful question to ask).

1. **The Experience Share**: Relate a real client case study and key insight.

3. **The Contrarian Insight**: Challenge a common belief with data.
4. **The Specific Question**: Ask an insightful question to spark conversation.
