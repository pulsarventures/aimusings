Last Friday, February 28, I had the opportunity to attend #TEDxAtlanta, centered around the theme ‚ÄúThe Future We Create.‚Äù As I made my way home, I realized it had been one of the best days of my life. When someone asked me what I learned, I found that more than facts or takeaways, what stayed with me were the emotions: energized, enlightened, educated, and empowered.

I intentionally waited a week before sharing to make sure I felt the same way‚Äîand yes, I do. Here are the highlights:

‚ú® **The Experience**  
The production, atmosphere, and even the food were outstanding‚Äîhuge kudos to the organizers and volunteers! I‚Äôve attended my fair share of trade shows and full-day workshops, but this was different. From 9 AM to 5 PM, with breaks in between, we heard from 18‚Äì20 speakers‚Äîand not once did I feel the urge to check my laptop (there was the occasional phone use during breaks). There was no multitasking, just pure engagement.

Many speakers guided us through self-discovery exercises, asking us to close our eyes and imagine moments from the past or the future. It was a unique and thought-provoking experience.

‚ú® **Engaging Conversations**  
I had the pleasure of meeting and having meaningful discussions with Shafika H., Savannah Sanford, Annie Kuensting, MA, and Luis Torres-Bohl.

Looking forward to the next #TEDxAtlanta and the ideas it will spark! I would highly recommend attending one if you have the opportunity.
