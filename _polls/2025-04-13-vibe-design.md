When I’m building out a product idea, my workflow usually looks like this:

1. I start with pen and paper – sketching out ideas helps me think.
2. I create diagrams or maps in XMind or Excalidraw.
3. I “vibe write” specs with ChatGPT in Canvas mode.
4. I "vibe code" using Claude + Cursor. 
5. I push code via a DevOps pipeline between GitHub and AWS. *(More on this in a separate post.)*

But I’ve noticed I’m missing a step in between **3** and **4** — call it **“vibe design.”**

Back in the day, I’d work with product or UX designers using Figma. We’d iterate a few times using annotations, markups, and comments until the design was good to go. That worked well.

### So here’s my question:

What are product designers using these days for that early-stage **“vibe design”** phase? Going straight to code breaks my flow state, and sometimes I lose sight of what I’m actually trying to build and focus on some unnecessary technical things.

1. **v0 Vercel**: Tried it, but I’m already in a "coding" mindset.
2. **Replit and Loveable**: Tried these too, but as a programmer, I prefer the control I get with Cursor. Also, they’re more about "building" apps, not designing them.

I’m looking for something more like a **Copilot** — like ChatGPT or Cursor, but for **UX/UI prototyping**. Something that helps me quickly sketch, refine, and maybe even generate clickable prototypes before diving into code — for myself, for sharing with other developers, or for sharing with prospects.

Would love to hear what others are using. Please vote [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7317187987115552769/)!
