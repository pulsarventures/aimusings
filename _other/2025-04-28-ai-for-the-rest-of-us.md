Last week, we hosted our second AI for the Rest of Us session, focused on how learning about AI together in a community makes navigating rapid change more manageable. Based on the energy and feedback, we’re now evolving into two tracks — AI for Technologists and AI for Business Owners — to better serve different needs and interests.

  

The goal was simple:

  

-> Acknowledge that AI-driven change is happening at breakneck speed.

  

-> Recognize that keeping up can feel overwhelming.

  

-> Emphasize that learning together — in a community setting — makes all the difference.

  

A huge thank you to [Karen Cashion](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and [Tech Alpharetta](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) for providing an amazing venue and supporting this initiative.

  

What stood out to me most: the real-time community engagement through conversations and live polling something no LinkedIn post, YouTube video, or book can replicate.

  

I’m also excited to share that based on the feedback and follow up from this and previous session we will look to evolve this into two themes,

  

𝐀𝐈 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐬

- For Architects and Builders ready to embrace the new AI-driven world

- You love to whiteboard, geek out, review code etc

  

𝐀𝐈 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐁𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐎𝐰𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐬

- For Entrepreneurs business outcomes, separating signal from noise

- You can define use cases and want to leverage AI to solve problems

More to come soon.

  

If you’re interested in joining either track, drop a comment or DM me — would love to hear from you!
