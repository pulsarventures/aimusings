Prasad Vangavolu and I, along with the EZ Innovation Team, have had the privilege of working with several exciting startups in Metro Atlanta. Wanted to take a moment to highlight a few as of Mar 2025

- **Believ** – *Sanjay Ahuja*, *Amyn Sadruddin*, and the team are building a fully automated and compliant onboarding platform powered by Conversational AI. Their solution streamlines verification and real-time data intelligence, making onboarding faster, seamless, and compliant.
- **Exitous, Inc.** – Founded by *Keita Wangari*, a human-centered platform designed to support individuals navigating job transitions. Excited to see her accepted into **#Techstars** and preparing for a private beta launch soon! (Ok - I lied - she's based in CA.)
- **Honey to Cocoa** – Led by *Riean Knight*, this startup is using technology to help people of color match makeup to their unique skin tones. Riean is also a proud **#Techstars** alum.
- **Metric Mate** – *M-T Strickland* and his team have developed Training Accountability Partner (T.A.P.) technology, transforming any resistance training equipment into a smart fitness tracker. Another **#Techstars** alum - check them out on **#SharkTank**!
- **Musidy** – A music streaming platform connecting users with local artists, allowing them to stream music, discover new talent, follow and rate musicians, and find live events. Looking forward to their Summer 2025 launch!
- **Nimble Connect** – *Thomas Hooper* and *Alison Hooper* are dedicated to strengthening the nonprofit ecosystem, helping donors build meaningful, lasting connections with the causes they care about.
- **Ramped Up** – *Scott Miller* and his team provide comprehensive B2B data solutions, offering millions of contact profiles, including email, employment data, and company intelligence.
- **SafeRoute** – Founded by *Reid Michalek*, *Greg Michalek*, and *Zach Zimmerman*, enhancing public safety by providing real-time notifications to drivers about approaching emergency vehicles, reducing accidents and improving response times.

Through these collaborations, we’ve built two-sided marketplaces, leveraged AI/ML algorithms to build workflows and recommendation engines, mobile and web applications, and more.

A big thank you to our partners at **Tech Alpharetta**, **Atlanta Tech Village**, **ATDC**, and **The Entrepreneurial Hour** for fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in our community! *Karen Cashion*, *Jade Rodgers*, *Ania Lackey*, *Charles (Chuck) Kaucher*, *John Avery*, *Avoilan Bingham*, *Kristin Slink*.
