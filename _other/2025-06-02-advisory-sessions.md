Startups don’t need formal structures to engage customers—they just need the courage to show up. On June 22 and 29, 
we held two unscripted Zoom sessions with our early community to gather sharp, immediate feedback on our products and philosophy. 
This spirit of jugaad—scrappy, adaptive problem-solving—fuels our decision to host open sessions every last Thursday of the month, 
building in public with purpose and momentum.


You don’t need a formal boardroom to hear the voice of your customer.
You just need a Zoom link, a calendar invite, and the courage to show up.

Startups are scrappy by design.
We improvise. We adapt. We run on feedback, not formality.
But that doesn’t mean we skip the feedback, or the conversations or the accountability.

Right now, we don’t have:

→ A Board of Directors with quarterly syncs
→ A polished Customer Advisory Board
→ A structured AMA cadence

But we do have something even better: momentum and community and the spirit of showing up.

On June 22 and June 29, we ran two informal Zoom sessions with our early community. No slides. No script. Just an open line and an honest conversation.

What happened?

→ People showed up.
→ The questions were sharp.
→ The feedback was immediate and impactful.

We talked about,

→ Our conviction that we’re not just living in the Information Age anymore — we’re stepping into the Intelligent Age.
→ Our belief in thinking in arcs, quadrants, and Venn diagrams — Assist → Augment → Automate → Autonomy.
→ Our flywheel: content → classes → community → projects → products and how they are interrelated
→ The products we’re building: 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀.𝗮𝗶, 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗟𝗶𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗿𝘆 and 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘁𝗣𝗶𝗹𝗼𝘁

So we’re making this a habit:

Starting now, we’ll host an open session every last Thursday of the month.

In India, there’s a word for this mindset: jugaad — clever hacks that get things done despite constraints. It’s a spirit I deeply relate to.

You don’t need permission to build in public.
You don’t need perfect structure to build with purpose.
You just need people who care.
And if you’re lucky, they’ll help you build better than you ever could alone.

Thank you for your time!
