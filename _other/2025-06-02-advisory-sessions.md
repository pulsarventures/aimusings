You don’t need a formal boardroom to hear the voice of your customer.

You just need a Zoom link, a calendar invite, and the courage to show up.



Startups are scrappy by design.

We improvise. We adapt. We run on feedback, not formality.

But that doesn’t mean we skip the feedback, or the conversations or the accountability.



Right now, we don’t have:



→ A Board of Directors with quarterly syncs

→ A polished Customer Advisory Board

→ A structured AMA cadence



But we do have something even better: momentum and community and the spirit of showing up.



On June 22 and June 29, we ran two informal Zoom sessions with our early community. No slides. No script. Just an open line and an honest conversation.



What happened?



→ People showed up.

→ The questions were sharp.

→ The feedback was immediate and impactful.



So we’re making this a habit:



Starting now, we’ll host an open session every last Thursday of the month.



In India, there’s a word for this mindset: jugaad — clever hacks that get things done despite constraints. It’s a spirit I deeply relate to.



You don’t need permission to build in public.

You don’t need perfect structure to build with purpose.

You just need people who care.

And if you’re lucky, they’ll help you build better than you ever could alone.



Thank you for your time!
