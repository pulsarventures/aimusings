**AI Musings**

- Observations as we shift from the Information Age to the Intelligent Age and the role that AI is playing to shape it

- Started as a few notes, now a steady rhythm of posts.

- Ideas collated from real conversations, product development, and project work at [Pulsar Ventures](https://pulsarventures.io).


**What to Expect**

- Each post either _zooms in_ on a product/project or _zooms out_ to explore broader shifts.

- Posts will eventually evolve into themed sections and chapters.


If you’re building at the intersection of AI, business, and human behavior — I hope something here sparks your own thinking.

P.S. I considered calling these deliberations, reflections, or ruminations—but “musings” felt just right. It strikes a balance between being informative and fun, without sounding too formal or serious (which, if you know me, isn’t really my vibe). Hope you enjoy the content!
