## The Business Landscape is Evolving

- **Industrial Age**
    Machines replaced human labor.
- **Information Age**
    Internet, automation, and global connectivity.
- **Intelligent Age**
    AI and human co-intelligence redefining business.

Our approach uses **vertical agents**—trained for specific domain-oriented tasks—working together in an **agentic workflow** that blends human input with automation. A **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** ensures the right agent handles the right task, improving efficiency and decision-making. Over time, **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** helps these agents learn from real-world use, becoming more effective and autonomous while staying aligned with business goals.

1. **Assist**
     AI enhances research, insights, and recommendations.
2. **Automate**
     AI executes repetitive tasks, freeing up human focus.
3. **Augment**
     AI works alongside humans, optimizing decision-making.
4. **Autonomy**
     AI independently drives workflows (future vision).
