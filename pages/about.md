**AI Musings** started as a personal writing system — a place to capture the patterns I was seeing as AI became more embedded in how we live and work. What began as a few notes and reflections turned into a steady rhythm of posts — each one zooming in on a moment or zooming out to examine the bigger shifts in motion.

These will be a series of personal observations I have been making as we transition from the Information Age to the Intelligent Age. As I integrate AI into both my work and personal life, I find myself noticing patterns —- whether I’m Zooming In on an AI-augmented task or Zooming Out to reflect on broader themes across work, life, and conversations with others.

P.S. I considered calling these deliberations, reflections, or ruminations—but “musings” felt just right. It strikes a balance between being informative and fun, without sounding too formal or serious (which, if you know me, isn’t really my vibe). Hope you enjoy the content!

These are currently individual posts, but over time I’ll be organizing them into sections and chapters.

But, this isn’t just a side project.

It’s closely connected to the work we're doing at [Pulsar Ventures](https://pulsarventures.io) — where we help founders and operators navigate the edge of what’s next. Whether we’re building systems, launching agent-based workflows, or rethinking business models for the Intelligent Age, the ideas explored here often serve as a testing ground. Many of the posts you’ll find in AI Musings are distilled from real conversations, product experiments, or strategic frameworks we’re shaping inside Pulsar.

At its core, this series is about making sense of change. It’s part documentation, part provocation — a way to keep learning out loud.

If you’re someone building at the intersection of AI, business, and human behavior — I hope you’ll find something here that sparks your thinking.
