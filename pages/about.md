About AI Musings

AI Musings started as a personal writing system — a place to capture the patterns I was seeing as AI became more embedded in how we live and work. What began as a few notes and reflections turned into a steady rhythm of posts — each one zooming in on a moment or zooming out to examine the bigger shifts in motion.

But this isn’t just a side project.

It’s closely connected to the work we're doing at Pulsar Ventures — where we help founders and operators navigate the edge of what’s next. Whether we’re building systems, launching agent-based workflows, or rethinking business models for the Intelligent Age, the ideas explored here often serve as a testing ground. Many of the posts you’ll find in AI Musings are distilled from real conversations, product experiments, or strategic frameworks we’re shaping inside Pulsar.

At its core, this series is about making sense of change. It’s part documentation, part provocation — a way to keep learning out loud.

If you’re someone building at the intersection of AI, business, and human behavior — I hope you’ll find something here that sparks your thinking.
