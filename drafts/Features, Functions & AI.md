Absolutely, that sounds like a powerful post. Here’s a draft structure and sample content that we can refine together:

### **Features, Functions & AI Agents: Why Outcomes Matter More Than Outputs**

  

As product builders, we’ve been trained to ship features. As operators, we obsess over functions. Now with AI agents in the mix, the landscape is evolving — fast.

  

But in the race to innovate, it’s easy to forget the real goal: **outcomes, not outputs**.

  

#### **Features = Outputs**

  

Features are what we _build_ — the buttons, dashboards, or automations we release to users. They’re tangible, visible, and easy to list in a changelog. But features alone don’t move the needle unless they solve a meaningful problem.

  

#### **Functions = Capabilities**

  

Functions describe what a system _can do_ — send an email, run a report, classify a lead. They’re a layer deeper than features, but still largely focused on mechanics. Helpful, but still not the endgame.

  

#### **Agents = Intent + Action**

  

AI Agents raise the bar. They don’t just _do_ things; they can _decide_ what to do. They bring autonomy, context-awareness, and learning. But here’s the trap: just because an agent can do something doesn’t mean it’s valuable.

  

Which brings us to the real metric that matters.

  

#### **Outcomes = Value Delivered**

  

What we should really be aiming for is the **business or human outcome**:

- Did revenue increase?
    
- Did the user spend less time?
    
- Did something meaningful improve?
    

  

The shift from outputs to outcomes is a mindset. It means:

- Don’t just ask “What can this feature do?”
    
- Ask “What problem does this solve, and how will we measure success?”
    

  

#### **My POV**

  

As we build the next generation of tools — powered by AI, designed for autonomy — we need to anchor ourselves not in the shiny new capabilities, but in clear, measurable outcomes. That’s how we avoid building “cool” things that no one needs.

  

Features and functions will always matter. But they’re only valuable **in service of outcomes**.
