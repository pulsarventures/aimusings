### **From “Who Not How” to “Which Agent, Not How” – Rethinking Leverage in the Intelligent Age**

- **1. The Next “Who” Might Be Digital:**  
    In the Intelligent Age, _Agents_ (AI tools, autonomous systems, specialized bots) can perform tasks once reserved for expert humans — turning "Who can do this for me?" into "Which Agent can do this for me?"
    
- **2. Capability > Headcount:**  
    Scaling no longer depends solely on hiring talent. Intelligent Agents can augment or even replace traditional roles, enabling individuals and small teams to punch far above their weight.
    
- **3. Workflow as a Conversation:**  
    Just as you'd brief a teammate, you now _prompt_ an Agent. The skillset shifts from doing the task to knowing how to delegate it clearly to the right system — promptcraft becomes the new management.
    
- **4. Agentic Leverage is Infinite Leverage:**  
    Where human “Whos” are constrained by time and attention, Agents can work 24/7, parallelize, and improve through feedback. Delegation becomes exponential.
    
- **5. Your Network Now Includes Agents:**  
    Success in the Intelligent Age depends not just on your human network, but also on your _Agent network_ — the set of AI systems you deploy, trust, and refine for your personal and business goals.

Let me know if you want to build this into a full LinkedIn post, visual graphic, or even a framework (e.g. _Who Not How 2.0: People + Agents_).

Here’s a polished **AI Musings post** built from your “Who Not How → Intelligent Agents” idea using your v1 prompt template. It captures your tone, integrates examples, and offers visual and influencer suggestions:

## ⚡️ **What if “Who Not How” now includes... Agents?**

In 2020, _Who Not How_ by Dan Sullivan flipped the productivity mindset:  
Stop asking “_How can I do this?_” — instead ask, “_Who can do this with or for me?_”

But as we enter the **Intelligent Age**, I believe we need to ask a new question:

> “Which Agent — not How — can move this forward?”

We’re evolving from **team-building** to **agent-orchestrating**.

## 📌 The New Frontier: Agentic Collaboration

Let’s reframe this through today’s lens:

- **Then:**  
    Find a marketing expert to write your campaign copy.
    
- **Now:**  
    Use an Agent trained on your brand tone + audience to generate first drafts and A/B test ideas overnight.

Here’s how this shift plays out across real scenarios:

🧠 **Strategy Planning**  
Instead of spending days building a market landscape from scratch, I deploy a Research Agent to synthesize insights from earnings calls, investor decks, and analyst reports — in minutes.

📣 **Sales Prospecting**  
No more toggling between LinkedIn, Apollo, and CRMs. My Reach Agent finds leads, drafts first messages, and follows up with context-aware nudges.

🛠️ **Product Development**  
Think “Coder as Co-Founder” — I now write high-level specs while a Dev Agent scaffolds the frontend in React and wires up APIs using FastAPI or Postgres.

These aren’t one-off hacks. They are beginning to resemble a **stack of intelligent teammates** — each Agent with a specialized role, learning and improving as we go.

## 🎯 Rethinking “Delegation”

Dan Sullivan’s original idea was all about freedom:

> “You can have anything you want — if you find the right Who.”

Today, you can go **further and faster** if you also include the right _Agent_.

Just like you’d hire a fractional CMO, now you might onboard:

- A Research Agent
    
- A Writing Agent
    
- A QA Agent
    
- A Customer Success Agent
    

And the best part?  
They don't sleep. They don’t burn out. And when trained well, they _compound_ your capability.

## 🧩 Hybrid Work = Human + Agent

I still believe in people.  
Human Whos bring empathy, vision, judgment, and trust.

But in this new era, knowing **which Agents to deploy** becomes as strategic as knowing who to hire.

It’s no longer just _Who Not How._  
It’s also:

> _Which Agent, in What Sequence, to drive What Outcome?_

Welcome to the age of _Agentic Leverage_.
