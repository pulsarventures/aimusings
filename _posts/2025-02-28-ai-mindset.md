If Mindset is Everything, here’s what’s been shifting mine. Lately, I’ve been consuming a mix of thought-provoking ideas that are reshaping how I think about AI, intelligence, and work. No particular order—just perspectives that have made me pause and rethink:

### Key Influences & Ideas
- **Sam Altman** - [Intelligence Age – The Age of Intelligence](https://ia.samaltman.com/)
- **Satya Nadella** - Agents, UI, and Databases – SaaS applications
- **Ethan Mollick** - Co-Intelligence – Living & Working with AI
- **Lex Fridman** - AI Deep Dives – Conversations on AI
- **Naval Ravikant** - [The All In Podcast](https://lnkd.in/eVX_hUYS) – Naval on AI, society, and the future (and in general tweets on X)
- **Usman Sheikh** - Consultants vs. AI Agents – Thought-provoking take
- **Sergio Rio** - Long and deep conversations on “Augmentation”

### Observations, Feelings, and Musings
1. **If Corporations are legally people, could AI eventually become “citizens”?**  
    This hit me while establishing culture "principles and values" for the team while simultaneously setting Cursor "rules."

2. **AI first, UI next**  
    Why build forms to collect data and dashboards to display them when we can have conversational agents that can collect data and give you specific answers? Startups are shifting how they think about UX.

3. **Who to leverage — Human, AI, or a combination?**  
    Every task is now in question: Who can do this best? For example, when I need a landing page—should I ask a human designer or an AI agent?
