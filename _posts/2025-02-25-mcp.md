I‚Äôve been diving into **Model Context Protocols (MCPs)** and exploring various discussions across LinkedIn, X, and YouTube. Most conversations seem focused on setting up MCP servers (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf) and connecting them with tools like Supabase, Firecrawl, and others. Additionally, there are plenty of directories to explore, such as Smithery.

### Key Questions:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ For Developers:
How are you keeping track of which MCPs are actually working and which aren‚Äôt?  
Currently, it seems like the best approach is following influencers on X or YouTube. Is there a better way to stay updated?

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ For Business Professionals:
I recently spoke with a provider of a multi-sided marketplace aggregating content from various artists. They want to publish that content on their website and currently have two options:  
- **Redirect to the provider**: Ensures up-to-date content but sacrifices audience control.  
- **ETL/API-based integration**: Syncs data but requires scheduled updates or pub/sub models.

I see MCP client/server architecture as a promising alternative. Would love to hear your thoughts‚Äîdoes this resonate with your experience?
