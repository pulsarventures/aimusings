Focus on AI's impact and user experience, not its mechanics, emphasizing seamless integration and empowering outcomes over technical details.

We need to reframe the conversation around AI.

Too often, the spotlight is on the agent itself:

- How it was built.
- What stack it uses.
- How it is engineered.

But that’s like talking about a car and spending all your time on how the factory is laid out and who worked on the car.

Yes, the build matters.  
But that’s not why people fall in love with cars.

Last week, I visited the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart with my son.  
And here’s what struck me:

The focus wasn’t on the factory floor or the production lines.  
It was on the design. The drive. The emotion.  
Stories of legendary models, the elegance of engineering, and the feeling of sitting behind the wheel.

No one was obsessing over which robot bolted the frame.  
They were talking about how it drives.

We need the same shift in how we think about AI Agents.

- **AI Agents are not the product.**
- **They shouldn't be your pitch.**
- **They shouldn't be your headline.**

They are the drivetrain.  

The quiet force under the hood that:

- Assists execution behind the scenes.
- Automates the routine so you can focus on the meaningful.
- Augments human capability.
- Accelerates decisions and workflows.
- Amplifies what teams can do.

It’s not about showcasing every prompt, parameter, or pipeline.  
It’s about what got done, what moved, what changed.

### So how do we build toward that?

#### → Invisible Execution  
Let the agent do the work without making its presence the feature.  
The most powerful systems are the ones you never have to think about.

#### → Abstracted UX  
We shouldn’t force users to interact with “the AI.”  
We should give them a product that just feels right — that makes progress feel effortless.

Just like a great car leaves you feeling, “that felt amazing.”

---

The mindset shift is simple, but essential:  

**AI agents are not the product.  
They are what powers the product.**

Let’s stop obsessing over the mechanics.  
Let’s start delivering the drive.
