AI Musings – Conference Rooms to Kitchen Tables

AI is no longer just a conference room conference call — it’s becoming deeply personal. Last night Pooja Rastogi a Sr. Project Manager came over, not to chat casually, but to explore how she could bring AI into her workplace. Over tea, we went from tool choices to transformation arcs, showing that the most powerful AI adoption while may get started in a corporate setting is often amplified through trusted, everyday conversations 


The AI conversation isn’t just happening on Slack threads or LinkedIn feeds anymore.
It’s moving into our neighborhoods, communities — and kitchen tables.

Yesterday, it got even more personal.

Pooja Rastogi, a very good friend of mine, came over to chat. But not about movies or weekend plans. She brought her laptop and a real-world question:

“How can I advocate for AI at work — and help teach and train my peers?”

What made it more striking is this:
→ We live close by
→ Our kids are the same age
→ We share a social circle, weekend routines, even Netflix and YouTube playlists

And yet, the conversation was about exploration of AI at work.

She’s a Sr. Project Manager within in a PMO. 

We zoomed in:

→ Nuances around data privacy at her company
→ How AI could support through various phases in a typical methodology (design->develop->deploy->support)
→ Tooling that they use (and are allowed to use)



We then zoomed out:

→ How to think in arcs — Assist → Automate → Augment → Autonomy
→ Patterns I’m seeing across other companies
→ How teams and org structures might shift


This wasn’t a client call. It was chai, curiosity, and conversation

And that’s what makes it powerful.

Then → AI was a professional topic, discussed in webinars and workshops
Now → It’s a social conversation, showing up among friends and neighbors

Sometimes it starts when a friend brings over her laptop and says:
“I’ve been thinking about this, I have to make a presentation on this topic. Can you help me figure it out?”

And honestly, that might be the most powerful vector for AI adoption:
→ Not corporate mandate
→ But trusted, peer-led conversations
→ Rooted in shared experience and real motivation

So ask yourself:
When was the last time a friend brought over their laptop… to talk AI?

If it hasn’t happened yet, it will.
And when it does — lean in.

Thank you, Pooja.

Takeaway:
The AI conversation is no longer confined to tech teams or Twitter threads.
It’s peer-led, human-centered, and increasingly part of everyday life.
If you’re not having it — you’re not hearing the signal.
