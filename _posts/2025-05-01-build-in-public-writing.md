This post shares my journey from casually posting on LinkedIn to building a structured content workflow under the Build In Public moniker. It highlights how I use simple tools—like Markdown, GitHub Pages, and spreadsheets—alongside AI to refine ideas, maintain consistency, and publish across platforms. The goal: write in public, stay in control, and let the system power creativity.

I never planned to start a content system. I just wanted to share ideas in public.

The spark came on Feb 28 2025
At a TED talk in Atlanta — “The Future We Build.”
It hit me: I’ve been thinking out loud for years, but always in private.

So I posted.

One post turned into five.
Then ten.
Then a rhythm.
Some reflections, some frameworks, some lessons in motion.

A month later, I noticed I had something worth shaping.
Not just random thoughts — but a process.

I started calling it AI Musings.

It helped me write better.
Build better.
Even think better.

But then the system showed a weak point — it was all on LinkedIn.
What if I was locked out? What if I wanted to distribute elsewhere?

So I adapted.


Combination of AI Musings and Build In Public.

A moniker that felt broader, more honest, more open.

I got a domain.
Skipped the CMS rabbit hole.
While I use Gamma quite a bit for LinkedIn Posts didn't quite feel right.
Chose .md files over polished dashboards.
Kept it simple.

The new workflow:

→ Capture ideas based on observations or questions
→ Let them simmer in a master spreadsheet
→ Outline them by hand
→ Feed a template into ChatGPT
→ Get a clean version for LinkedIn
→ Publish a Markdown version to GitHub

And here’s the real win:

I didn’t do it alone.
Shoutout to Madhavan Sridharan, who helped me set up: (he has a thing for documentation!)
	•	GitHub Pages
	•	Jekyll with built-in themes and some customizations
	•	Pipeline to publish

Now each piece I write lives in two places:
LinkedIn (for community) and AIMusings.space (for permanence)

Next up on the roadmap:
	•	Push to Substack and Medium
	•	Auto-generate videos for YouTube


Then vs Now

Then: Post when I feel like it.
Now: A lightweight system that supports consistency.

Then: Just LinkedIn.
Now: A multi-channel publishing stack with version control.

Then: “Just write.”
Now: “Design your writing system.”


Build In Public isn’t just a phrase.
It’s a creative discipline.
An invitation to think in the open.
To share your systems, not just your outputs.

You don’t need a fancy tool. You need a repeatable workflow.

Start small. Stay public.
And let the flywheel kick in.
