Had the chance to attend a great talk by [Neha Negandhi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/publicspeakingcoachtedxspeaker/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3BuLcM4vv4T0OJoQhtTBs2zw%3D%3D) and [Javier Santana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javierjsantana/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3BuLcM4vv4T0OJoQhtTBs2zw%3D%3D) on Tuesday at [Tech Alpharetta](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tech-alpharetta/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3BuLcM4vv4T0OJoQhtTBs2zw%3D%3D) . Coincidentally, I had spoken at the same venue just the day beforeâ€” interesting to return as an observer and take notes!

A few takeaways from the non AI side of life:

- Finding passion in what you do makes storytelling easy.
- It all starts with you look inward.
- Authenticity matters, especially now that everyone can write ðŸ˜‰
 
Lately, Iâ€™ve been at a bit of a crossroads, sitting in on AI roundtables and talking to several people both online and in-person. These conversations have sparked a few reflections, questions, and sheer curiosity about this new AI way of life - and these are not one off conversations !

- If AI replaces entry-level roles in coding, marketing, customer service, etc., how will young people learn the ropes? (Social media has already made some dents here)
- When and how will schools start teaching kids about AI?
- What role will chatbots and AI play in how people process emotions, relationships, and loneliness?
- As we increasingly interact and collaborate with AI agents, whatâ€™s the right way to communicate with them? Should we be polite? Direct? Does it even matter?
