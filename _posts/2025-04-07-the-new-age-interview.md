Reflects on rigorous interview preparation, including Amazon's structured process, leadership principles, STAR-format storytelling, and lessons from a Fractional CTO interview.

## My Interview Experiences: A Tale of Two Processes

I've been through my fair share of interviews, but two stand out:

1. **The Amazon Loop** for a Solutions Architect role in 2022  
2. **A Fractional CTO Interview** just last week

### The Amazon Loop: Reflection, Preparation, Execution

The Amazon process was rigorous, structured, and deeply introspective. Here’s what it looked like:

#### Process:
- **Recruiter Screening**
- **Manager Screening**
- **Technical Exercise**
- **The Loop:**
  - Two interviews with the immediate team (deep dive into the technical exercise)
  - One interview with the extended team
  - One interview with the hiring manager
  - One interview with the Bar Raiser

#### Preparation (took ~1 month):
- Studied the **Leadership Principles**
- Watched countless Jeff Bezos videos on YouTube (repeatedly)
- Identified **50–75 LP-aligned scenarios** from my past, which translated into approximately **20 Stories**
- Structured answers using the **STAR** format


### Visuals from My Journey

Here are a couple of images that capture moments from my interview preparation journey:
