This post explores the future of AI agents in enterprises, addressing governance, marketplaces, training, and their integration alongside human workers.

Ahead of a discovery session with [PeopleFlow.io](https://peopleflow.io), I had the chance to watch this [Workday AI video](https://lnkd.in/etePhJ_X) and walked away with some intriguing concepts.

I’ve believed for some time now that the enterprise of tomorrow will consist of both people and AI agents working side by side. This talk reinforced some of my thinking while also sparking new questions:

- **The Rise of AI Agents & Governance** – As AI agents proliferate, if an agent is assisting or augmenting a human, should RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) dynamically apply to that agent? When the human leaves the company or transfers to a different department, what happens to these agents?
- **Agent Marketplaces** – The idea of a marketplace for agents—where providers, customers, and partners can create and deploy them—is compelling. But it raises big questions:
    - How do we contract with an agent?
    - How do we compensate them?
    - Can an agent hire another agent?
    - Who will be the “Agent Marketplace” of tomorrow—#Workday, #Agentforce, or #UpWork in the coming years?
- **Testing & Training AI Agents** – As these digital entities become more prevalent, how should we test and train them to ensure reliability, compliance, and performance?

As AI agents become an integral part of the workforce, these are just some of the challenges (and opportunities!) we’ll need to navigate. What are your thoughts on the future of AI agents in the enterprise?
