The pace of AI innovation is now so fast that even experts struggle to keep up, with dozens of major releases happening weekly. 
To manage this overwhelming firehose of updates, I use a simple swipe-based mental model — left for irrelevant, right for interesting, 
and down for important — helping me stay focused and reduce FOMO. In the AI era, the real advantage isn’t knowing everything, but knowing what to ignore.

Every week feels like a decade in AI.

If you blinked, you missed a dozen breakthroughs.
Last couple of weeks, the headlines were overflowing:

→ Claude 4 (Anthropic)
→ Codex Agent (OpenAI)
→ 150+ Agents in WatsonX (IBM)
→ Mistral Medium 3
→ Jules, Search AI Mode (Google)
→ 50+ tools for the Agentic Web (Microsoft)
→ Copilot Studio: Multi-agent orchestration
→ SAP’s AI Foundation
→ Shopify AI Store Builder
→ AWS Strands – open agent SDK
→ Windsurf SWE‑1 for DevOps
→ Claude + Cursor + Windsurf via OpenMemory MCP
→ Hugging Face’s Open Computer Agent
→ Firefly Image 4 (Adobe)
→ DeepSeek’s reasoning model
→ OpenAI reportedly acquires Jony Ive’s firm for $6.4b
→ OpenAI reportedly acquires Windsurf for $3b


And the list doesn’t include Microsoft Build, Google I/O, or SAP Sapphire — all happening simultaneously.

The problem?
Even the most tuned-in professionals can’t keep up.
What used to be a drip of innovation is now a full-on flood.
Velocity has outpaced cognition and the volume of updates is now too overwhelming to track "without a system".

So here’s what I do.
It’s not perfect, but it’s workable.
A simple mental model based on Swiping - just like a dating app and no I am not on dating apps :) 

When news comes in from the top, I mentally swipe:

→ Swipe Left – Cool, but not for me.
(Too far outside my context)

→ Swipe Right – Interesting. Will revisit.
(Something I might try or add to my radar)

→ Swipe Down – Urgent. Must explore now.
(Shifts how I build, plan, or think — immediately)


You can’t outrun the news cycle.
But you can rewire how you engage with it.

Why this works:

– It reduces overwhelm.
– It helps me prioritize by context, not just hype.
– It shifts my energy from FOMO to Focus.


You don’t need to follow everything.
You just need a approach on what to follow.
And the courage to ignore more than you follow.

Because in the AI era, time and attention is your asset.

Let me know how you’re filtering the AI firehose.
