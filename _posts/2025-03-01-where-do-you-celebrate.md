As a builder, I often just want to talk shopâ€”connect with others, exchange ideas, and see how people are adapting to new tech, tackling real-world use cases, and solving problems (not pushing products, not raising money)

Hereâ€™s how I currently do it:
ðŸ”¹ Leveraging my professional network built over the years
ðŸ”¹ Engaging with the Atlanta Tech Scene (Tech Alpharetta , Atlanta Tech Village)
ðŸ”¹ Attending AI Tinkerers Meetups (thanks cc Avoilan Bingham Joe Heitzeberg)

But Iâ€™m curiousâ€”whatâ€™s the best platform for you to:
a) Find other builders who share your interests?
b) Engage in real conversations to teach, learn, and collaborate?


Would love to hear your thoughts! ðŸ‘‡
