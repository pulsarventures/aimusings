AI Musings - Fly Wheel Effect - a well-designed flywheel doesn’t just spin faster — it becomes inevitable. And behind the scenes, AI is amplifying every turn — helping us capture insights faster, spot patterns earlier, and move from idea to action.  
  
What’s the real power behind Amazon’s dominance?  
Not just better prices, faster shipping, or wider selection — but the compounding momentum between them.  
  
Each advantage feeds the next.  
Each turn of the wheel makes the next easier.  
  
Last week, I found myself reflecting on the flywheel we’re quietly building across our brands. It’s different from Amazon’s — but just as deliberate.  
  
Here’s how our flywheel is starting to take shape:  
  
Content  
-> Distributed both online and through community settings  
-> Sparks conversations, learning, visibility  
  
Projects  
-> Emerging directly from the pulse of those conversations  
-> Shaped by real client input, real-world needs  
  
Products  
-> Born from a deeper layer: observations, experiments, lived experiences  
-> Solve problems we didn’t just imagine — that we felt.  
  
Each layer strengthens the others.  
Content fuels Projects.  
Content and Projects surface needs for Products.  
Projects and Products provide insights to power new Content.  
  
And the cycle doesn’t just spin — it compounds.  
  
Then:  
You created a service or product, then went looking for people to sell it to.  
  
Now:  
You create community and conversations first — and let the right services and products emerge naturally from them.  
  
How this is changing my mindset,  
- Think less in terms of one-off wins.  
- Think more in terms of perpetual motion.  
  
Curious to hear what flywheel are you building ?
