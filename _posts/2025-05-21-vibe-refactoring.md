Sometimes vibe coding isn’t about shipping new features—it’s about cleaning up old ones with precision. 
I used Cursor’s agent to refactor mislabeled code in my app, turning what would’ve been a tedious manual task into a smooth, 
efficient flow. Agentic development brings the same creative energy to refactoring as it does to building.

I wasn’t building a new app. I was cleaning up an existing one.

Here’s what happened:
I spotted a mismatch in the left nav pane of my app.
One tab said “Network”. The code still called it “Social”.

Old me would’ve jumped into the code, changed variable names, moved files, tested routes. You know the drill.
But that approach has a cost—especially when you’re short on time and mental bandwidth.


But this time, I didn’t feel like doing a full manual pass.

So I opened Cursor and gave my Agent a task:
“Can you help me refactor social activity to network activity?”

The agent got to work:
	•	Renamed variables and files
	•	Updated routes
	•	Deleted legacy references
	•	Even caught and resolved a 404 that popped up

What would’ve been a 30 min chore took 3 minutes.

The Lesson?

Not every coding session needs to start from scratch.
Not every AI assist needs to be flashy.

Agentic Development isn’t just about shipping new features fast—
It’s about delegating maintenance, cleanup, and code hygiene too.

Next time you spot some legacy code that needs a cleanup, try giving it to your Agent instead of procrastinating.

You don’t always need a new build to vibe.
Sometimes, it’s enough to refactor with rhythm.
