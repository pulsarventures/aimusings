The QA role is quietly transforming from testing interfaces to evaluating agent behavior and reasoning. Instead of pass/fail scripts, testers now focus on behavior coverage, feedback loops, and system observability. Quality is no longer just about functionality — it’s about understanding why an AI system acted the way it did.

We’re watching job roles bend, blur, and rewire themselves in real time.

- Product Managers are becoming app builders.
- Solution Architects are turning into full-stack developers.
- BizOps and DevOps teams are stitching systems together like engineers.
- Specialized engineers are rapidly evolving into full-stack engineers(expanding their scope to include not just frontend and backend, 
but also AI, ML, and data science — blurring the lines between traditional software and intelligent systems development)

So it got me thinking:

How are QA professionals adapting to the rise of Agentic Systems?
In a world where autonomous agents are writing code, making decisions, and sometimes hallucinating with confidence — where does traditional QA fit?


The role of a tester is undergoing its own quiet revolution.

	•	Testing logic, not just layout
You’re no longer validating buttons and flows — you’re evaluating reasoning.
Did the agent act with intention? Was the output contextually sound?

	•	From test coverage to behavior coverage
Traditional test cases fall short when behavior is emergent and data-dependent.
Testing now means tracing decisions, validating logic paths, and spotting inconsistencies.

	•	Observability becomes central to quality
It’s no longer just about pass/fail — it’s about patterns, drift, and outcomes.
Feedback loops, usage signals, and behavioral insights are the new unit tests.
	•	From scripts to systems thinking

Quality now includes:
	•	Monitoring long-term performance shifts
	•	Capturing user feedback as reinforcement data
	•	Diagnosing regression in reasoning, not just functionality

If you’re in QA and you’re still testing like it’s 2020, I’d be concerned.

I’m working through a framework and a toolkit specifically for QA teams entering the Agentic SDLC.
If you’re navigating this shift (or coaching a team that is), let’s connect.
I’d love to co-create what the future of Agent Assurance could look like — with you.
	•	What tools are you picking up?
	•	What new heuristics are you developing?
	•	Are you rethinking how quality is even defined?
