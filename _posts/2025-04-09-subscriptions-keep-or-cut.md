Many of us are juggling multiple subscriptions—whether it’s for new age productivity (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Cursor) or entertainment (Netflix, Spotify).

Imagine you can only spend $20 and if you had to choose just one to keep, which one makes the cut —- and why?

I'll post my answer as the poll closes - but I am super clear on what my pick is and why? Curious to hear what others think…

<form action="/submit_poll" method="POST">
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="subscription" value="ChatGPT"> ChatGPT
  </label><br>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="subscription" value="Perplexity"> Perplexity
  </label><br>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="subscription" value="Cursor"> Cursor
  </label><br>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="subscription" value="Netflix"> Netflix
  </label><br>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="subscription" value="Spotify"> Spotify
  </label><br>
  <!--button type="submit">Submit</button-->
</form>
