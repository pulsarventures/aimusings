𝗔𝗜 𝗠𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 - 𝗠𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗠𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀

I got to do some deep and theoretical work on my flight back from Europe over the weekend (nothing better for than no WiFi, limited in-flight infotainment). 

As AI evolves and is intertwined into teams, process and tooling. Who sets the direction? Who defines the purpose? And who actually executes?

To explore this, I zoomed out—and connected three domains:

Physics - speed, direction, and acceleration.
Philosophy - intent and purpose.
Business - mission, vision, strategy, and execution.

I applied a couple of frameworks across Human + AI across foundational concepts,

- RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)
- Mapped AI’s 4 roles: Assist, Automate, Augment, Autonomy

My takeaway?
AI is accelerating how we move.
But humans are still accountable for why we move.
