Explores collaboration among builders, sharing personal methods like leveraging networks, meetups, and tech scenes, while seeking the best platforms for meaningful engagement.

As a builder, I often just want to talk shop—connect with others, exchange ideas, and see how people are adapting to new tech, tackling real-world use cases, and solving problems (not pushing products, not raising money)

Here’s how I currently do it:
🔹 Leveraging my professional network built over the years
🔹 Engaging with the Atlanta Tech Scene (Tech Alpharetta , Atlanta Tech Village)
🔹 Attending AI Tinkerers Meetups (thanks cc Avoilan Bingham Joe Heitzeberg)

But I’m curious—what’s the best platform for you to:
a) Find other builders who share your interests?
b) Engage in real conversations to teach, learn, and collaborate?
