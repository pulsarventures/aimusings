Iâ€™ve been experiencing a lot of flow state recently. Iâ€™ve read *Deep Work* by Cal Newport and recently came across an article by Greg Isenberg on why flow mattersâ€”especially for Founders and Creatives.

For a while, my personal preferences have been:

- **Environment** â€“ Coffee shops, bookstores, or open spaces and certainly not my desk from where I take meetings  
- **Music** â€“ Instrumental or Bollywood party beats  
- **Time of Day** â€“ Early mornings, often before  
- **Paper and Pens** â€“ Gel pens in a few different colors  

While these traditional preferences help set the stage, Iâ€™ve noticed something newâ€”an AI effect thatâ€™s enhancing the experience across the three main types of creative work I do:

- **Writing** â€“ Obsidian + ChatGPT (especially Canvas mode)  
- **Drawing** â€“ Excalidraw and Eraser (visual thinking)  
- **Coding** â€“ Cursor (agentic coding)  

Whatâ€™s surprised me most is the impact of these AI tools with chat-based UX. Two big shifts:  

1. I get into flow state sooner  
2. I stay in flow state longer  

And itâ€™s making me wonderâ€”  
Is it because Iâ€™m just talking to myself in zen mode? ðŸ™‚
