Building a B2C app isn’t just about vibe coding your way to a product—it takes clarity, structure, and the right leverage. With just three core builders, we’ve used AI as a co-pilot across roles—from product vision to backend architecture—turning vague ideas into executable momentum. It’s not about replacing thinking, but expanding capability through AI-augmented strategy and agent-powered execution.

“I’ll just vibe code the whole thing.”

That’s the fantasy.

That you’ll open your laptop, zone out with music, drink coffee, and—bam—an app appears.

In reality, for most B2C products with a long shelf life, that’s rarely how it works. And I say that as someone deep in the build right now.

We’re building a consumer app—starting from scratch—and I can tell you this:

AI has fundamentally reshaped the early-stage startup process.

But not in the “AI wrote all our code” way you might think.

Here’s the actual sequence we followed to go from vague idea to full-stack execution—with a team of three.

From Idea to Insight to Implementation

1. The Spark

The idea had been bouncing around in my head for years.

 • Deep in-person brainstorm with a team mate during a trip to Germany.
 • Long Walk, Drives and stuck and an Airplane for 12 hours from Turkey.
 • I binge listened to podcasts - Startup Ideas and My First Million in particular. Something clicked.

Sometimes, clarity needs distance.

2. Framing the Vision
 • Write up with pen and paper.
 • I sketched a mind map on paper.
 • Fired up ChatGPT, told it to act as a Product Manager and drafted the Product Vision Doc together: features, pricing, roadmap, competitive landscape...
 • Got early feedback from friends and collaborators.
 • Ran a customer discovery poll using mentimeter to test assumptions.

3. Architecting the Core - ChatGPT switched roles
 • Now as Data Architect - We co-designed the backend schema.
 • Then as a UX Designer: I shared design inspirations, competitive apps, and asked for UI/UX guidance.


4. Into the Build
 • The three of us now wear multiple hats: PM, Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Architect, AI/ML Engineer.
 • Every step—every block—is accelerated by asking the right questions to AI Agents.
 • We’re not outsourcing thinking. We’re extending our capability.

Then vs Now

Then: You needed a bigger team to get a product off the ground.

Now: With AI as scaffolding, three people can do the work of ten—if they know how to prompt, structure, and decide.

Here’s the real unlock:

AI doesn’t just give you speed.

It gives you confidence to move forward—even if you’re not an expert in every domain.

That’s what happened to me yesterday—chatting with ChatGPT mid-workout, switching it between roles to sanity-check backend logic and product copy.

This isn’t science fiction. It’s just… Tuesday.

So its not about vibe coding but about - AI augmented strategy and Agent powered execution.


PS:

- There are others involved in the team to help with other activities around Business Dev and Operations - I am addressing Building in this post
- I recognize Three Men can just as well be Three Women - just wanted something that rhymes :)
