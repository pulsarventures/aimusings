We explore transitioning from traditional BI UX to AI-driven Copilot interfaces for data interaction, seeking tools and ideas for implementation.

Fellow Builders,

Looking at KPI and metrics is old-school BI UX. However, based on personal experience and feedback, people increasingly prefer interacting with data through a Copilot interface. This includes text-based interactions and, eventually, voice-based Q&A, reasoning, and what-if scenarios—ushering in a new era of AI UX.

What have you found to be the best way to implement this? I’m looking for suggestions for both plug-and-play solutions with no lock-in (e.g., Amazon Q, Google Vertex AI, Langflow) and building from scratch. My tech stack includes React, Python, and Postgres on AWS. I’d love to see a functional demo in any vertical.

BTW, thanks to Cursor and Claude Sonnet 3.7—building this dashboard was super fast and effective!
