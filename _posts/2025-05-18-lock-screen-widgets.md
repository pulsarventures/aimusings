What begins as a simple desire to replace the iPhone’s lock screen camera with Perplexity reveals a deeper shift: AI tools are becoming ambient, something we want immediate, intuitive access to — not tucked away behind apps and tabs. The friction isn’t just technical, it’s conceptual — we’re starting to expect AI to be where we are, when we need it, as naturally as a flashlight or camera. And that’s not an Apple rant — it’s a signal that our relationship with technology is evolving from app-first to intent-first.


Google used to be my go-to for everything.
Now, I barely touch it for Search... sure I still use Chrome and YouTube.

I didn’t expect the iPhone home and lock screen to reflect a mindset shift. But it has for me.

We underestimate how much our habits are tied to interfaces.

For years, my lock screen buttons were static:
→ Flashlight
→ Camera

Functional. Predictable. Thoughtless.

Google Search was always there too — as default as default gets.

Then a couple things happened.

I bought the iPhone 16, not for the camera or titanium frame — but for Apple Intelligence.
Ironically, Siri still doesn’t hold up.
The only thing I have ended up using is the photo editor that removes people from the background :)
Even with ChatGPT in the backend, Siri doesn’t talk to me - it talks at me !

And like all shifts, it didn’t start big.
It started with a tiny glitch.

Chrome profiles were not working for me.
So I deleted and reinstalled it.

But this time…
I didn’t re-add the Google Search bar.

And I didn’t miss it.

Because now, I talk to “Cove.”
My ChatGPT interface.

Whether I’m thinking through strategy or asking about a recipe, it’s not a search anymore — it’s a conversation.

So I asked myself:

Why do I need Google?
Why do I need the flashlight button?
Why not replace them with something better?

So now, my home screen buttons are:
→ Perplexity
→ Perplexity

And that’s when I realized:
My screen didn’t just change.
My intent changed.

Then:
→ Default tools
→ Text based interactions
→ Google for everything

Now:
→ Intentional interfaces
→ Multimodal interactions
→ Best of breed AI tools


Is this revolutionary? No.
Is it a signal of the shift ahead? Absolutely.

Because in 2024–2025, AI isn’t showing up through breakthrough launches. It’s showing up through tiny decisions.

A lock screen button.
A replaced search bar.
A new pattern of asking before searching.

The AI moment is not an event.
It’s ambient.

Start paying attention to what you no longer do.
That’s where the shift is happening.

What have you stopped doing… without even noticing?

And, yes - I still take Photos and Videos and Apple gave me a special button for it with the iPhone 16

And no -  this is not an Apple rant 😀
