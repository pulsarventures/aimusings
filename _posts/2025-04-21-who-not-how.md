We used to ask: “Who can help me get this done?”
Now, in the Intelligent Age, the better question is:
Which Agent can do this for me?”. This shift isn’t subtle — it’s a complete rethinking of leverage.


**In the Industrial Age**, leverage was physical.

**In the Information Age**, leverage was digital.

**Now, in the Intelligent Age**, leverage is _agentic_ — driven by intelligent systems that think, reason, and act on our behalf.

The book _Who Not How_ gave us a powerful mindset: delegate to others, don’t do it all yourself.

But what if your next “Who” isn’t a person at all?


**Enter the Agent Era.**

Not virtual assistants. Not basic bots.

But _intelligent_, task-specific Agents — systems that can analyze, decide, and execute.

This changes everything:

1. **From Headcount to Capability**  
    You don’t need to hire a 5-person team to scale your startup.  
    One founder with the right stack of Agents can go toe-to-toe with companies 10x their size.

2. **Workflow Becomes a Conversation**  
    Just like you’d brief a colleague, now you _prompt_ an Agent.  
    The new managerial skill isn’t task execution — it’s _prompt precision_.

3. **Infinite Leverage**  
    Agents don’t sleep, don’t forget, and don’t get distracted.  
    They operate in parallel, iterate in real-time, and scale with every new dataset.

4. **The Rise of the Agent Network**  
    Your edge isn’t just who you know — it’s _what you deploy_.  
    Imagine your own intelligent stack of legal Agents, research Agents, proposal-writing Agents…  
    The new power network is hybrid: human and machine.


**So what does this mean for builders, operators, founders?**

You don’t need to reinvent the wheel.  
You need to rethink how it spins.

It’s not about learning how to do more.  
It’s about **delegating better to smarter systems**.

**Agentic leverage is the new compounding edge.**


**The question isn’t “How do I do this?” anymore.**  
It’s:  

**“Which Agent should I activate?”**

“This isn’t about replacing your human team with bots—it’s about thoughtfully building a hybrid team that fits your organization and enhances your life.”

The book by [Dr. Benjamin Hardy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drbenjaminhardy/) and [Dan Sullivan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dansullivansc/) had a profound impact on my thinking a few years ago. This weekend, watching [Flo Crivello](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florentcrivello/) on [Greg Isenberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gisenberg/) reinforced the above insights and echoed with the theme that [Usman Sheikh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/usmans/) talks about in his posts.
