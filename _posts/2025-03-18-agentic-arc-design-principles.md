Design agentic systems by leveraging OOP, modularization, low-code tools, traditional tech stacks, and staying updated on AI trends for scalable, efficient architectures.

Time to code is reducing by the day and it is highly likely that the tooling you used or tech stack you used will change before you complete your project. Here are some principles to consider when designing agentic systems, 

- Leverage Object-Oriented Programming Concepts – such as abstraction, interfaces, stubs, implementations, and extensions to build scalable and maintainable architectures.

- Modularize MCP Servers & Agents – Implement them as independent containers or serverless functions.

- Make Agents Atomic – Each Agent should focus on a single, well-defined function.

- Leverage low-code tools like [#n8n](https://n8n.io) and [**#Langflow**](https://langflow.org) for rapid prototyping, much like Figma for UI design before moving to React

- Stick with traditional tech stacks for complex and heavy duty workloads ex. React, Python, and PostgreSQL running on a hyperscaler or ETL tools like AWS Glue or Azure Fabric to move data

- Know that it is just a matter of time before we see [#purpose-built-llm](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fpurpose&trk=public_post-text) just as AWS introduced the concept of Purpose-Built Databases, tailored for different enterprise needs.

- Continuously absorb content from the likes of [Y Combinator](https://www.linkedin.com/school/y-combinator/?trk=public_post-text), [AI Tinkerers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ai-tinkerers?trk=public_post-text) not necessarily for the app ideas but for how designers and developers are approaching building them - the AI User Experience is different from UI User Experience and is more than just Chatbots
