How did the pricing of $20 for the paid versions of tools like ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity come up? I am trying to figure out how to price some of the AI Offerings I am creating - products and services.

Of course I asked these LLM's how they came up with this and here is summary of what they are telling me,

The pricing of $20 per month for various AI assistant services appears to be a common industry standard that has emerged, rather than a result of a specific calculation or strategy. This pricing point seems to have been adopted by multiple companies for their premium AI services.

My thought is that this happened over a couple of beers (while watching Netflix and listening to Spotify and looking at their pricing) rather than considering Development and Operational Costs - how else that could it be that while so much changes are happening with AI by the day in terms of newer versions and models but the $20 pricing has fixed since Nov 2022 ðŸ™‚ and OpenAI talks about a $20, $200 and $20,000 plan (not sure what the $2,000 plan would offer, the hyped $20,000 was about replacing PhDs)

Sure - Grok is around $40 at this time and linked to X pricing but then Elon is different..

A few more reflections of what must have been the thought process,

 1. Market competitiveness: By matching each otherâ€™s prices, these services remain competitive and avoid pricing themselves out of the market.
 2. Perceived value: The $20 price point may represent a balance between affordability for individual users and the perceived value of advanced AI capabilities.
 3. Psychological pricing: $20 is a round number thatâ€™s easy for consumers to understand and budget for on a monthly basis.

Would love to discuss how other companies are coming up with pricing strategies - drop me a note or DM me!
