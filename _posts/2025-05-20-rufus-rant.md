Even trillion-dollar companies can stumble with AI when context is missing. When I asked Amazonâ€™s AI assistant, Rufus, to compare selfie sticks in my cart, it gave generic responses and then admitted it didnâ€™t actually have access to my cart. The lesson? Donâ€™t fake AI intelligenceâ€”transparency builds trust, especially at key decision moments.

Even trillion-dollar companies can get AI wrong.

I was looking to buy a selfie stick and, instead of bothering my teenage sons for advice (like I usually do and since all of us are supposed to be doing AI first ðŸ˜€), I decided to ask Rufusâ€”Amazonâ€™s shiny new AI assistant

Me - "can you compare the 3 selfie sticks on my cart?"

Rufus - "Hereâ€™s how the selfie sticks in your cart compare" 

and gives me 3 generic answers and when I clicked on option 3, it took me to a general search page.

I am confused now...

Me - "are you searching for stuff on Amazon or are these the 3 selfie sticks on my cart?"

Rufus - "I donâ€™t have have access to your cart, but I can provide a general comparison based on common features of selfie sticks"

Wait, what?

So hereâ€™s the irony: it pretended to understand, gave me a generic answer, and when challenged, admitted it couldnâ€™t actually do what I asked.

Hereâ€™s the takeaway:
If youâ€™re building AI tools, context is everything.
Donâ€™t fake helpfulnessâ€”earn trust by being transparent.
Especially at the final decision-making moment.

Iâ€™m still shopping on Amazon.
I just wonâ€™t be asking Rufus for advice anytime soon.
