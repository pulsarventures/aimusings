I started looking at the list of AI tools I have been using regularly, and the list includes what you might expect: ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Gamma, Gemini, Grok, Leonardo, Perplexity (alphabetically listed).

As I looked closer, two main categories of use emerged:

### Categories of Use
1. **Research Work**
2. **Creative Work**

I also broke it down into sub-categories in each of these areas, and clear patterns emerged:

#### Research
- Based on time sensitivity and factual accuracy.

#### Creative
- Based on the type of task.

### Observations

#### ChatGPT
- My go-to for multi-modal work.
- Love Canvas mode for collaborative editing.
- When it comes to specialized work, it is more of a miss than a hit.
- Don’t really toggle as much between 4.0, 4.5, o1, o3-mini models, etc.

#### Claude + Cursor Combo
- Get instructions from Claude (e.g., for building the app).
- Drop them in Cursor Agent mode.
- Use the same models between both (e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.7).

### Additional Observation
I’m craving a new category: **AI Agents** that can operate and manage across work streams or just help me manage work—my own PM assistant. There’s way too much context switching.
