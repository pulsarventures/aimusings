The AI landscape is shifting from modular stacks to vertically integrated ecosystems like Google’s, which combine tools, workflows, and infrastructure for building intelligent agents. These ecosystems promise speed, clarity, and scalability but reduce portability. Drawing parallels to early cloud computing, the author questions when to commit to a provider, considering time-to-market, platform risk, and agent maturity.

**Are we heading toward the “AWS moment” for Agentic AI?**

  

For the past year, we’ve been building on a fairly modular stack — Python, OpenAI, LangChain, Crew, LLMs from different providers.

  

**No real lock-in. Maximum flexibility.**

That was the goal.

  

But something’s shifting.

  

The major players are no longer just offering _models_. They’re stitching together entire _ecosystems_ — complete with orchestration layers, agent frameworks, hosting environments, and model routing built in.

  

**Google’s ecosystem is quietly leading the charge.**

Between **Agentspace**, **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**, **Gemini 2.5**, and **Firebase Studio**, they’re not just offering tools — they’re offering opinions on _how_ agents should be built, run, and evolve.

  

And it’s working. Developers are paying attention.



**So the question I’m sitting with:**

**When — and how — do you go all-in on one Agentic Ecosystem provider?**

  

Here’s how I’m breaking it down so far:

  

**1. Time-to-Build vs. Time-to-Market**

→ Ecosystems like Google’s promise tighter integration.

→ Fewer glue layers = faster iteration loops.

  

**2. Opinionated Workflows = Clarity**

→ Less “choose-your-own-adventure,” more “this is how it works.”

→ That’s not always bad. Especially at scale.

  

**3. Portability (or the lack thereof)**

→ The deeper you go, the harder it gets to swap later.

→ So the upside has to justify the platform risk.

  

**4. Agent Maturity & Infrastructure**

→ Google’s Agentspace has context-aware routing, memory, chaining, and A2A protocols.

→ It’s a vision of agents _as infrastructure_, not just tools.


**Then:**

LLMs were treated like interchangeable batteries.

Plug them in, wrap them in LangChain, run the show.

  

**Now:**

We’re moving toward **vertical integration** — model, memory, hosting, and interaction logic in one place.

Like cloud computing in 2006… we might be at the **PaaS moment** for intelligent agents.


**The Big Shift?**

  

We used to ask: _“Which model should I use?”_

Now we’re asking: _“Which ecosystem should I build on?”_

  

And soon, we’ll be asking:

**“Which agents already exist — and can I just deploy them?”**

  

Curious to hear how others are thinking about this.

  

**What criteria are you using to evaluate whether to go all-in on a provider like Google, OpenAI, Amazon, or others?**

Would love your thoughts.
