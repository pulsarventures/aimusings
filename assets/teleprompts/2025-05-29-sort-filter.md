AI Musings - sort and filter

 Teleprompter script


(Segment 1 1: Opening – Direct Address to Camera)

Hey everyone —

If you’ve been trying to keep up with AI lately, you’re probably overwhelmed.
I know I am.

Just last week, we’ve seen new agents, SDKs, model releases, platform updates, and acquisitions — across OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, and a dozen others.


But here’s the problem — you can’t track everything.

So I use a mental model to sort the noise.
I call it: Swipe and Sort.

Let me show you how it works.


(Segment 2: Before)

For context let us review a typical LinkedIn post that talks about Product and Feature updates - looks something like this..



(Segment 3: Show Your “Map” or Visual Framework)


Imagine news comes at you from the top of your feed.
Your job isn’t to read it all — it’s to sort it fast.

How I do it:

→ Swipe Left – Not for me.
Stuff that’s cool, but not relevant to my work or direction.

→ Swipe Right – Interesting, not urgent.
Might circle back later. I’ll tag it, save it, maybe test it in a week.

→ Swipe Down – Must explore now.
Things that could change how I build, think, or advise — immediately.

It’s like dating apps… but for noise vs signal filtering.


(Segment 4: Return to LinkedIn Post – Use Rhythm & Arrow Cues)

So now let's return to the same LinkedIn post with this filter

It looks something like this..

→ SAP AI Foundation – Swipe Left
Interesting… but I’m not building in that ecosystem.

→ Google’s Jules – Swipe Right
Could be big. But I’ll wait to see traction.

→ OpenMemory MCP – Swipe Down
Interoperable memory across agents? That’s a shift worth watching.

→ Claude 4 – Swipe Right
This is a flagship model with major implications.

You get the idea.

You'll also notice that most of what I was looking at from my lens was noise not signal.

(Segment 5 Closing – Bring It Home)

You don’t need to follow everything.
You just need a approach on what to follow.
And the courage to ignore more than you follow.

Because in the AI era, time and attention is your asset.

Let me know how you’re filtering the AI firehose.
