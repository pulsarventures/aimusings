# Finciples

**Empowering investors with principles-based analysis, combining AI-powered insights with proven investment philosophies.**

## Project Overview

Finciples is a platform that brings together the power of artificial intelligence with time-tested investment principles. The project aims to democratize access to high-quality investment analysis, making it available to both individual and institutional investors.

## Problem Statement

The investment world is complex and often overwhelming, especially for retail investors. There's an abundance of information but a shortage of actionable insights. Traditional analysis methods are often:

- Time-consuming
- Subject to human bias
- Inconsistent in application
- Not scalable across many assets

## Our Solution

Finciples addresses these challenges by creating a system that:

1. **Automates fundamental analysis** using AI to process large volumes of financial data
2. **Applies consistent principles** derived from successful investment philosophies
3. **Provides clear, actionable insights** without overwhelming the user
4. **Scales across thousands of assets** to identify opportunities

## Technology Stack

- **Data Processing**: Python-based ETL pipelines for financial data
- **AI Models**: Custom NLP models trained on financial documents and reports
- **Principles Engine**: Rule-based system codifying investment strategies
- **Web Platform**: React frontend with Node.js backend
- **APIs**: Integration with financial data providers

## Key Features

### Principles-Based Analysis
Each asset is analyzed through multiple lenses based on established investment philosophies:

- Value investing (Graham, Buffett)
- Quality investing (Novy-Marx)
- Growth at reasonable price (GARP)
- Momentum strategies

### Multi-Source Data Integration
Finciples integrates data from diverse sources:

- Company financial statements

### AI-Powered Insights
Our AI systems work to:

- Extract relevant information from unstructured text
- Identify patterns and anomalies in financial data
- Generate natural language explanations of findings
- Track changes and trends over time

## Current Status

## Future Roadmap

1. **Q2 2025**: Public beta launch
2. **Q3 2025**: Mobile app release
3. **Q4 2025**: Premium features for institutional investors
